	abstract = {A large portion of the stream mining studies on classification rely on the availability of true labels immediately after making predictions. This approach is well exemplified by the test-then-train evaluation, where predictions immediately precede true label arrival. However, in many real scenarios, labels arrive with non-negligible latency. This raises the question of how to evaluate classifiers trained in such circumstances. This question is of particular importance when stream mining models are expected to refine their predictions between acquiring instance data and receiving its true label. In this work, we propose a novel evaluation methodology for data streams when verification latency takes place, namely continuous re-evaluation. It is applied to reference data streams and it is used to differentiate between stream mining techniques in terms of their ability to refine predictions based on newly arriving instances. Our study points out, discusses and shows empirically the importance of considering the delay of instance labels when evaluating classifiers for data streams.},

        , The new Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emerging disease responsible for infecting millions of people since the first notification until nowadays. Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow forecasting the number of future cases. In this context, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths. In this paper, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with one, three, and six-days ahead the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states with a high daily incidence. In the stacking-ensemble learning approach, the CUBIST regression, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian process (GP) as meta-learner. The models’ effectiveness is evaluated based on the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking-ensemble learning reach a better performance regarding adopted criteria than compared models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting, achieving errors in a range of 0.87\%–3.51\%, 1.02\%–5.63\%, and 0.95\%–6.90\% in one, three, and six-days-ahead, respectively. The ranking of models, from the best to the worst regarding accuracy, in all scenarios is SVR, stacking-ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models. The use of evaluated models is recommended to forecasting and monitor the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models can assist the managers in the decision-making support systems.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 outbreak has become a global pandemic that affected more than 200 countries. Predicting the epidemiological behavior of this outbreak has a vital role to prevent its spreading. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) network as a robust deep learning model is proposed to forecast the number of total confirmed cases, total recovered cases, and total deaths in Saudi Arabia. The model was trained using the official reported data. The optimal values of the model’s parameters that maximize the forecasting accuracy were determined. The forecasting accuracy of the model was assessed using seven statistical assessment criteria, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), efﬁciency coefﬁcient (EC), overall index (OI), coefficient of variation (COV), and coefﬁcient of residual mass (CRM). A reasonable forecasting accuracy was obtained. The forecasting accuracy of the suggested model is compared with two other models. The first is a statistical based model called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The second is an artificial intelligence based model called nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). Finally, the proposed LSTM model was applied to forecast the total number of confirmed cases as well as deaths in six different countries; Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, and USA. These countries have different epidemic trends as they apply different polices and have different age structure, weather, and culture. The social distancing and protection measures applied in different countries are assumed to be maintained during the forecasting period. The obtained results may help policymakers to control the disease and to put strategic plans to organize Hajj and the closure periods of the schools and universities.},

	abstract = {The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health problem once according to the World Health Organization up to June 24th, 2020, more than 9.1 million people were infected, and more than 470 thousand have died worldwide. In the current scenario, the Brazil and the United States of America present a high daily incidence of new cases and deaths. Therefore, it is important to forecast the number of new cases in a time window of one week, once this can help the public health system developing strategic planning to deals with the COVID-19. The application of the forecasting artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential of deal with dynamical behavior of time-series like of COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition (VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three, and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states, with a high number of cases up to April 28th, 2020. Previous cumulative COVID-19 cases and exogenous variables as daily temperature and precipitation were employed as inputs for all forecasting models. The models’ effectiveness are evaluated based on the performance criteria. In general, the hybridization of VMD outperformed single forecasting models regarding the accuracy, specifically when the horizon is six-days-ahead, the hybrid VMD–single models achieved better accuracy in 70\% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, the importance ranking as predictor variables is, from the upper to the lower, past cases, temperature, and precipitation. Therefore, due to the efficiency of evaluated models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to six-days-ahead, the adopted models can be recommended as a promising models for forecasting and be used to assist in the development of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) based forecasting mechanisms have proved their significance to anticipate in perioperative outcomes to improve the decision making on the future course of actions. The ML models have long been used in many application domains which needed the identification and prioritization of adverse factors for a threat. Several prediction methods are being popularly used to handle forecasting problems. This study demonstrates the capability of ML models to forecast the number of upcoming patients affected by COVID-19 which is presently considered as a potential threat to mankind. In particular, four standard forecasting models, such as linear regression (LR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine (SVM), and exponential smoothing (ES) have been used in this study to forecast the threatening factors of COVID-19. Three types of predictions are made by each of the models, such as the number of newly infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries in the next 10 days. The results produced by the study proves it a promising mechanism to use these methods for the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results prove that the ES performs best among all the used models followed by LR and LASSO which performs well in forecasting the new confirmed cases, death rate as well as recovery rate, while SVM performs poorly in all the prediction scenarios given the available dataset.},

Although governments imposing numerous containment and social distancing measures, the need for the healthcare systems has dramatically increased and the effective management of infected patients becomes a challenging problem for hospitals. Thus, accurate short-term forecasting of the number of new contaminated and recovered cases is crucial for optimizing the available resources and arresting or slowing down the progression of such diseases. Recently, deep learning models demonstrated important improvements when handling time-series data in different applications. This paper presents a comparative study of five deep learning methods to forecast the number of new cases and recovered cases. Specifically, simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated recurrent units (GRUs) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) algorithms have been applied for global forecasting of COVID-19 cases based on a small volume of data. This study is based on daily confirmed and recovered cases collected from six countries namely Italy, Spain, France, China, USA, and Australia. Results demonstrate the promising potential of the deep learning model in forecasting COVID-19 cases and highlight the superior performance of the VAE compared to the other algorithms.},

Fitting mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to the available epidemiological data provides a key statistical tool for understanding the many quantities of interest that are not explicit in the underlying epidemiological data streams. Of these, the basic reproductive ratio, R, has taken on special significance in terms of the general understanding of whether the epidemic is under control (R {\textless} 1). Unfortunately, none of the epidemiological data streams are designed for modelling, hence assimilating information from multiple (often changing) sources of data is a major challenge that is particularly stark in novel disease outbreaks., Here, focusing on the dynamics of the first-wave (March-June 2020), we present in some detail the inference scheme employed for calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model to the available public health data streams, which span hospitalisations, critical care occupancy, mortality and serological testing. We then perform computational simulations, making use of the acquired parameter posterior distributions, to assess how the accuracy of short-term predictions varied over the timecourse of the outbreak. To conclude, we compare how refinements to data streams and model structure impact estimates of epidemiological measures, including the estimated growth rate and daily incidence.},

	abstract = {Background: The emergence of COVID-19 has created an urgent threat to public health worldwide. With rapidly evolving demands on healthcare resources, it is imperative that healthcare systems have the ability to access real-time local data to predict, plan, and effectively manage resources.
Objective: To develop an interactive COVID-19 Utilization and Resource Visualization Engine (CURVE) as a data visualization tool to inform decision making and guide a large health system’s proactive pandemic response.
Methods: We designed and implemented CURVE using R Shiny to display real-time parameters of healthcare utilization at Atrium Health with projections based upon locally derived models for the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the CURVE app to compare predictions from two of our models –one created before and one after the statewide stay-at-home and social distancing orders (denoted beforeand after-SAH-order model). We established parameter settings for best-, moderate-, and worst-case scenarios for pandemic spread and resource use, leveraging two locally developed forecasting models to determine peak date trajectory, resource use, and root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted results.
Results: CURVE predicts and monitors utilization of hospital beds, ICU beds, and number of ventilators in the context of up-to-date local resources and provides Atrium Health leadership with timely, actionable insights to guide decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. The after-SAH-order model demonstrated the lowest RMSE in total bed, ICU bed, and patients on ventilators.
Conclusions: CURVE provides a powerful, interactive interface that provides locally relevant, dynamic, timely information to guide health system decision making and pandemic preparedness.},

	abstract = {{\textless}div{\textgreater}To date, the novel Corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions and has caused the deaths of thousands of people around the world. At the moment, five antibodies, two from China, two from the U.S., and one from the UK, have already been widely utilized and numerous vaccines are under the trail process. In order to reach herd immunity, around 70\% of the population would need to be inoculated. It may take several years to hinder the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Governments and concerned authorities have taken stringent measurements such as enforcing partial, complete, or smart lockdowns, building temporary medical facilities, advocating social distancing, and mandating masks in public as well as setting up awareness campaigns. Furthermore, there have been massive efforts in various research areas and a wide variety of tools, technologies and techniques have been explored and developed to combat the war against this pandemic. Interestingly, machine learning algorithms and internet of Things (IoTs) technology are the pioneers in this race. Up till now, several real-time and intelligent COVID-19 forecasting, diagnosing, and monitoring systems have been proposed to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article based on our extensive literature review, we provide a taxonomy based on the intelligent COVID-19 forecasting, diagnosing, and monitoring systems. We review the available literature extensively under the proposed taxonomy and have analyzed a significantly wide range of machine learning algorithms and IoTs which can be used in predicting the spread of COVID-19 and in diagnosing and monitoring the infected individuals. Furthermore, we identify the challenges and also provide our vision about the future research on COVID-19.{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

Poor data input, wrong modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, poor past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, consideration of only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand, lack of expertise in crucial disciplines, groupthink and bandwagon effects, and selective reporting are some of the causes of these failures. Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making. When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence.},

In this paper, we introduce Fr{\textbackslash}'echet trees and Fr{\textbackslash}'echet random forests, which allow to handle data for which input and output variables take values in general metric spaces (which can be unordered). To this end, a new way of splitting the nodes of trees is introduced and the prediction procedures of trees and forests are generalized. Then, random forests out-of-bag error and variable importance score are naturally adapted. A consistency theorem for Fr{\textbackslash}'echet regressogram predictor using data-driven partitions is given and applied to Fr{\textbackslash}'echet purely uniformly random trees. The method is studied through several simulation scenarios on heterogeneous data combining longitudinal, image and scalar data.

La pandémie COVID-19, qui a débuté au début de l’année 2020, paralyse la planète depuis de nombreux mois. Plusieurs pays qui ont été durement touchés par une première vague ont connu une accalmie avant de faire face à un nouveau pic épidémique. Le climat joue potentiellement un rôle dans la propagation de nombreux virus respiratoires. Il est apparu important de savoir si cela pouvait être aussi le cas pour le nouveau coronavirus, le SARS-CoV-2. Si le rôle du climat dans la transmission est encore difficilement quantifiable, il est clair que d’autres facteurs rentrent en compte dans la transmission de la COVID-19 à savoir principalement le respect des règles de distanciation physique et des gestes barrières.
Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020 has been paralyzing the planet for several months. Several countries, who were hardly hit by a first wave, experienced a lull period before facing a second epidemic peak. Climate potentially plays a role in the spread of many respiratory viruses. Thus, it is vital to know whether this could also be the case for the new coronavirus. While the role of climate in transmission is still difficult to infer, it is clear that other factors matter in the transmission of COVID-19, notably the respect of physical distancing rules and barrier gestures.},

There were two proposed methodologies in making predictions 28 days ahead for the number of new cases, deaths, and ICU patients of five European countries: Portugal, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany. A case study of the results of massive immunization in Israel was also considered. The data input of cases, deaths, and daily ICU patients was normalized to reduce discrepant numbers due to the countries’ size and the cumulative vaccination values by the percentage of population immunized (with at least one dose of the vaccine). As a comparative criterion, the calculation of the mean absolute error (MAE) of all predictions presents the best methodology, targeting other possibilities of use for the method proposed. The best architecture achieved a general MAE for the 1-to-28-day ahead forecast, which is lower than 30 cases, 0.6 deaths, and 2.5 ICU patients per million people.},

With the advent of data-sharing, computational approaches have gained a key role in evaluating future scenarios. To design optimal social, hospitalization and economical strategies that guarantee control over the pandemic progression, we developed a data-driven modelling framework with the aim to provide reliable near future predictions under constantly evolving social and pandemic conditions. The framework is flexible enough to be used at a single hospital, regional or national level. We used a variety of data such as social, serological, testing and clinical data to compute the infection dynamics and the hospital workload for France. We developed inference methods to calibrate model parameters from observed hospitalization statistics over adjustable time periods. We applied our model to study the age stratified pandemic evolution inside and outside hospitals until February 2021, and the competition between vaccinations and the novel delta variant. We obtained predictions about hidden pandemic properties such as fractions of infected, infection hospitality and infection fatality ratios. We show that reproduction numbers and herd immunity levels are not universal but depend on the underlying social dynamics, and in presence of the delta variant should be above 90\%. Finally, we conclude that vaccination of the young generation should be pursued before all social restrictions are relieved.},

The accuracy of the regional predictions was improved by using a hierarchical pre-training scheme, and an efficient parallel implementation allows for quick training of multiple regional models.

          Abstract
          
            Europe is now considered as the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, France being among the most impacted country. In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (
            R
            0
            = 1.5,
            R
            0
            = 2.25,
            R
            0
            = 3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (
            R
            0
            = 1.5) to 161,832 in the worst case (
            R
            0
            = 3), while the total number of deaths would vary from 1,021 to 11,032, respectively. At the regional level, all ICU capacities may be overrun in the worst scenario. Only seven Regions may lack ICU beds in the mild scenario (
            R
            0
            = 2.25) and only one in the best case. In the three scenarios, Corse may be the first Region to see its ICU capacities overrun. The two other Regions, whose capacity will be overrun shortly after are Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. Our analysis shows that, even in the best case scenario, the French healthcare system will very soon be overwhelmed. While drastic social distancing measures may temper our results, a massive reorganization leading to an expansion of French ICU capacities seems to be necessary to manage the coming wave of critically affected COVID-19 patients.},

Six areas where AI can contribute to the fight against COVID-19 are discussed, namely i) early warnings and alerts, ii) tracking and prediction, iii) data dashboards, iv) diagnosis and prognosis, v) treatments and cures, and vi) social control. It is concluded that AI has not yet been impactful against COVID-19. Its use is hampered by a lack of data, and by too much data. Overcoming these constraints will require a careful balance between data privacy and public health, and rigorous human-AI interaction. It is unlikely that these will be addressed in time to be of much help during the present pandemic. In the meantime, extensive gathering of diagnostic data on who is infectious will be essential to save lives, train AI, and limit economic damages.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The Seattle, WA, area was ground zero for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Its initial emergence in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) not only highlighted the vulnerability of its patients and residents, but also the limited clinical support that led to national headlines. Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic heightened the need for improved collaboration among healthcare organizations and local and state public health. METHODS The University of Washington Medicine's (UWM's) Post-Acute Care (PAC) Network developed and implemented a three-phase approach within its pre-existing network of SNFs to help slow the spread of the disease, support local area SNFs from becoming overwhelmed when inundated with COVID-19 cases or persons under investigation, and help decrease the burden on area hospitals, clinics, and emergency medical services. RESULTS Support of local area SNFs consisted of the following phases that were implemented at various times as COVID-19 impacted each facility at different times. Initial Phase: This phase was designed to (1) optimize communication, (2) review infection control practices, and (3) create a centralized process to track and test the target population. Delayed Phase: The goals of the Delayed Phase were to slow the spread of the disease once it is present in the SNF by providing consistent education and reinforcing infection prevention and control practices to all staff. Surge Phase: This phase aimed to prepare facilities in response to an outbreak by deploying a 'Drop Team' within 24 hours to the facility to expeditiously test patients and exposed employees, triage symptomatic patients, and coordinate care and supplies with local public health authorities. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 Three-Phase Response Plan provides a standardized model of care that may be implemented by other health systems and SNFs to help prepare and respond to COVID-19.

	abstract = {Background
In the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly data related to the burden of care required by infected patients were reported. The aim of this study was to illustrate the timeline of actions taken and to measure and analyze their impact on surgical patients.

Method
This is a retrospective review of actions to limit Covid-19 spread and their impact on surgical activity in a Swiss tertiary referral center. Data on patient care, human resources and hospital logistics were collected. Impact on surgical activity was measured by comparing 6-week periods before and after the first measures were taken.

Results
After the first Swiss Covid-19 case appeared on February 25, progressively restrictive measures were taken over a period of 23 days. Covid-19 positive inpatients increased from 5 to 131, and ICU patients from 2 to 31, between days 10 and 30, respectively, without ever overloading resources. A 43\% decrease of elective visceral surgical procedures was observed after Covid-19 (295 vs 165, p{\textless}0.01), while the urgent operations (all specialties) decreased by 39\% (1476 vs 897, p{\textless}0.01). Fifty-two and 38 major oncological surgeries were performed, respectively, representing a 27\% decrease (p = 0.316). Outpatient consultations dropped by 59\%, from 728 to 296 (p{\textless}0.01).

Conclusion
While allowing for maximal care of Covid-19 patients during the pandemic, the shift of resources limited the access to elective surgical care, with less impact on cancer care.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00484-6},
	abstract = {Background
Timely, accurate, and comprehensive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 daily infection rates, cumulative infections, the proportion of the population that has been infected at least once, and the effective reproductive number (Reffective) are essential for understanding the determinants of past infection, current transmission patterns, and a population's susceptibility to future infection with the same variant. Although several studies have estimated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections in select locations at specific points in time, all of these analyses have relied on biased data inputs that were not adequately corrected for. In this study, we aimed to provide a novel approach to estimating past SARS-CoV-2 daily infections, cumulative infections, and the proportion of the population infected, for 190 countries and territories from the start of the pandemic to Nov 14, 2021. This approach combines data from reported cases, reported deaths, excess deaths attributable to COVID-19, hospitalisations, and seroprevalence surveys to produce more robust estimates that minimise constituent biases.

Methods
We produced a comprehensive set of global and location-specific estimates of daily and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections through Nov 14, 2021, using data largely from Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA) and national databases for reported cases, hospital admissions, and reported deaths, as well as seroprevalence surveys identified through previous reviews, SeroTracker, and governmental organisations. We corrected these data for known biases such as lags in reporting, accounted for under-reporting of deaths by use of a statistical model of the proportion of excess mortality attributable to SARS-CoV-2, and adjusted seroprevalence surveys for waning antibody sensitivity, vaccinations, and reinfection from SARS-CoV-2 escape variants. We then created an empirical database of infection–detection ratios (IDRs), infection–hospitalisation ratios (IHRs), and infection–fatality ratios (IFRs). To estimate a complete time series for each location, we developed statistical models to predict the IDR, IHR, and IFR by location and day, testing a set of predictors justified through published systematic reviews. Next, we combined three series of estimates of daily infections (cases divided by IDR, hospitalisations divided by IHR, and deaths divided by IFR), into a more robust estimate of daily infections. We then used daily infections to estimate cumulative infections and the cumulative proportion of the population with one or more infections, and we then calculated posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR using cumulative infections and the corrected data on reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. Finally, we converted daily infections into a historical time series of Reffective by location and day based on assumptions of duration from infection to infectiousness and time an individual spent being infectious. For each of these quantities, we estimated a distribution based on an ensemble framework that captured uncertainty in data sources, model design, and parameter assumptions.

Findings
Global daily SARS-CoV-2 infections fluctuated between 3 million and 17 million new infections per day between April, 2020, and October, 2021, peaking in mid-April, 2021, primarily as a result of surges in India. Between the start of the pandemic and Nov 14, 2021, there were an estimated 3·80 billion (95\% uncertainty interval 3·44–4·08) total SARS-CoV-2 infections and reinfections combined, and an estimated 3·39 billion (3·08–3·63) individuals, or 43·9\% (39·9–46·9) of the global population, had been infected one or more times. 1·34 billion (1·20–1·49) of these infections occurred in south Asia, the highest among the seven super-regions, although the sub-Saharan Africa super-region had the highest infection rate (79·3 per 100 population [69·0–86·4]). The high-income super-region had the fewest infections (239 million [226–252]), and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania had the lowest infection rate (13·0 per 100 population [8·4–17·7]). The cumulative proportion of the population ever infected varied greatly between countries and territories, with rates higher than 70\% in 40 countries and lower than 20\% in 39 countries. There was no discernible relationship between Reffective and total immunity, and even at total immunity levels of 80\%, we observed no indication of an abrupt drop in Reffective, indicating that there is not a clear herd immunity threshold observed in the data.

Interpretation
COVID-19 has already had a staggering impact on the world up to the beginning of the omicron (B.1.1.529) wave, with over 40\% of the global population infected at least once by Nov 14, 2021. The vast differences in cumulative proportion of the population infected across locations could help policy makers identify the transmission-prevention strategies that have been most effective, as well as the populations at greatest risk for future infection. This information might also be useful for targeted transmission-prevention interventions, including vaccine prioritisation. Our statistical approach to estimating SARS-CoV-2 infection allows estimates to be updated and disseminated rapidly on the basis of newly available data, which has and will be crucially important for timely COVID-19 research, science, and policy responses.

	abstract = {Learning from data streams is a research area of increasing importance. Nowadays, several stream learning algorithms have been developed. Most of them learn decision models that continuously evolve over time, run in resource-aware environments, detect and react to changes in the environment generating data. One important issue, not yet conveniently addressed, is the design of experimental work to evaluate and compare decision models that evolve over time. There are no golden standards for assessing performance in non-stationary environments. This paper proposes a general framework for assessing predictive stream learning algorithms. We defend the use of Predictive Sequential methods for error estimate – the prequential error. The prequential error allows us to monitor the evolution of the performance of models that evolve over time. Nevertheless, it is known to be a pessimistic estimator in comparison to holdout estimates. To obtain more reliable estimators we need some forgetting mechanism. Two viable alternatives are: sliding windows and fading factors. We observe that the prequential error converges to an holdout estimator when estimated over a sliding window or using fading factors. We present illustrative examples of the use of prequential error estimators, using fading factors, for the tasks of: i) assessing performance of a learning algorithm; ii) comparing learning algorithms; iii) hypothesis testing using McNemar test; and iv) change detection using Page-Hinkley test. In these tasks, the prequential error estimated using fading factors provide reliable estimators. In comparison to sliding windows, fading factors are faster and memory-less, a requirement for streaming applications. This paper is a contribution to a discussion in the good-practices on performance assessment when learning dynamic models that evolve over time.},

	abstract = {In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, governments are taking a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). These measures include interventions as stringent as strict lockdown but also school closure, bar and restaurant closure, curfews and barrier gestures i.e. social distancing. Disentangling the effectiveness of each NPI is crucial to inform response to future outbreaks. To this end, we first develop a multi-level estimation of the French COVID-19 epidemic over a period of one year. We rely on a global extended Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) mechanistic model of the infection including a dynamical (over time) transmission rate containing a Wiener process accounting for modeling error. Random effects are integrated following an innovative population approach based on a Kalman-type filter where the log-likelihood functional couples data across French regions. We then fit the estimated time-varying transmission rate using a regression model depending on NPI, while accounting for vaccination coverage, apparition of variants of concern (VoC) and seasonal weather conditions. We show that all NPI considered have an independent significant effect on the transmission rate. We additionally demonstrate a strong effect from weather conditions which decrease transmission during the summer period, and also estimate increased transmissibility of VoCs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported in part by Inria Mission COVID19, project GESTEPID.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:n/aAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Background The effect of vaccination for COVID-19 on onward transmission is unknown.Methods A national record linkage study determined documented COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations in unvaccinated household members of vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers from 8th December 2020 to 3rd March 2021. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 14 days following the first dose.Results The cohort comprised of 194,362 household members (mean age 31·1 ± 20·9 years) and 144,525 healthcare workers (mean age 44·4 ± 11·4 years). 113,253 (78·3\%) of healthcare workers received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and 36,227 (25·1\%) received a second dose. There were 3,123 and 4,343 documented COVID-19 cases and 175 and 177 COVID-19 hospitalisations in household members of healthcare workers and healthcare workers respectively. Household members of vaccinated healthcare workers had a lower risk of COVID-19 case compared to household members of unvaccinated healthcare worker (rate per 100 person-years 9·40 versus 5·93; HR 0·70, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0·63 to 0·78). The effect size for COVID-19 hospitalisation was similar, with the confidence interval crossing the null (HR 0·77 [95\% CI 0·53 to 1·10]). The rate per 100 person years was lower in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated healthcare workers for documented (20·13 versus 8·51; HR 0·45 [95\% CI 0·42 to 0·49]) and hospitalized COVID-19 (0·97 versus 0·14; HR 0·16 [95\% CI 0·09 to 0·27]). Compared to the period before the first dose, the risk of documented COVID-19 case was lower at ≥ 14 days after the second dose for household members (HR 0·46 [95\% CI 0·30to 0·70]) and healthcare workers (HR 0·08 [95\% CI 0·04 to 0·17]).Interpretation Vaccination of health care workers was associated with a substantial reduction in COVID-19 cases in household contacts consistent with an effect of vaccination on transmission.Competing Interest StatementPM and HC have received research grants from AstraZeneca.

	abstract = {Research data warehouses integrate research and patient data from one or more sources into a single data model that is designed for research. Typically, institutions update their warehouse by fully reloading it periodically. The alternative is to update the warehouse incrementally with new, changed and/or deleted data. Full reloads avoid having to correct and add to a live system, but they can render the data outdated for clinical trial accrual. They place a substantial burden on source systems, involve intermittent work that is challenging to resource, and may involve tight coordination across IT and informatics units. We have implemented daily incremental updating for our i2b2 data warehouse. Incremental updating requires substantial up-front development, and it can expose provisional data to investigators. However, it may support more use cases, it may be a better fit for academic healthcare IT organizational structures, and ongoing support needs appear to be similar or lower.},

What started as a small side project became a months long endeavor. 180 days and 180 forecasts later, the pandemic shows no signs of abating as we head towards winter. When I started covid19-projections.com, there were only a handful of existing models, and very few of them were accurate. Now, there are over 30 models on the CDC Forecasting page. A lot of great progress has been made in the modeling space over the past six months, and I hope others will get to better know these other models in the months to come. After much consideration, I have come to the difficult decision to not extend my projections beyond November 1, 2020. I plan to make the last forecast update to covid19-projections.com on Monday, October 5. This was undoubtedly a tough choice for me, and I hope to convey my thoughts in this post...},

	doi = {10.1093/jamiaopen/ooac086},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an accurate regional forecast algorithm to predict the number of hospitalized patients and to assess the benefit of the Electronic Health Records (EHR) information to perform those predictions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aggregated data from SARS-CoV-2 and weather public database and data warehouse of the Bordeaux hospital were extracted from May 16, 2020 to January 17, 2022. The outcomes were the number of hospitalized patients in the Bordeaux Hospital at 7 and 14 days. We compared the performance of different data sources, feature engineering, and machine learning models.
RESULTS: During the period of 88 weeks, 2561 hospitalizations due to COVID-19 were recorded at the Bordeaux Hospital. The model achieving the best performance was an elastic-net penalized linear regression using all available data with a median relative error at 7 and 14 days of 0.136 [0.063; 0.223] and 0.198 [0.105; 0.302] hospitalizations, respectively. Electronic health records (EHRs) from the hospital data warehouse improved median relative error at 7 and 14 days by 10.9\% and 19.8\%, respectively. Graphical evaluation showed remaining forecast error was mainly due to delay in slope shift detection.
DISCUSSION: Forecast model showed overall good performance both at 7 and 14 days which were improved by the addition of the data from Bordeaux Hospital data warehouse.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of hospital data warehouse might help to get more specific and faster information than traditional surveillance system, which in turn will help to improve epidemic forecasting at a larger and finer scale.},

	abstract = {Since the beginning of the epidemic, daily reports of CoViD-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths from around the world have been publicly available. This paper describes methods to characterize broad features of the spread of the disease, with relatively long periods of constant transmission rates, using a new population modeling framework based on discrete-time difference equations. Comparative parameters are chosen for their weak dependence on model assumptions. Approaches for their point and interval estimation, accounting for additional sources of variance in the case data, are presented. These methods provide a basis to quantitatively assess the impact of changes to social distancing policies using publicly available data. As examples, data from Ontario and German states are analyzed using this framework. German case data show a small increase in transmission rates following the relaxation of lock-down rules on May 6, 2020. By combining case and death data from Germany, the mean and standard deviation of the time from infection to death are estimated.},

Three years (2015, 2016 and 2017) of manual spine surgery monitoring have been used as a gold standard to extract features and train machine learning algorithms. The dataset contained 22 SSIs out of 2133 spine surgeries. Two different approaches were compared. The first used several data sources and achieved the best performance but is difficult to generalize to other institutions. The second was based on free text only with semiautomatic extraction of discriminant terms. The algorithms managed to identify all the SSIs with 20 and 26 false positives respectively on the dataset. Another evaluation is underway. These results are encouraging for the development of semi-automated surveillance methods.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide in unprecedented speed, and diverse negative impacts have seriously endangered human society. Accurately forecasting the number of COVID-19 cases can help governments and public health organizations develop the right prevention strategies in advance to contain outbreaks. In this work, a long-term 6-month COVID-19 pandemic forecast in second half of 2021 and a short-term 30-day daily ahead COVID-19 forecast in December 2021 are successfully implemented via a novel nanophotonic reservoir computing based on silicon optomechanical oscillators with photonic crystal cavities, benefitting from its simpler learning algorithm, abundant nonlinear characteristics, and some unique advantages such as CMOS compatibility, fabrication cost, and monolithic integration. In essence, the nonlinear time series related to COVID-19 are mapped to the high-dimensional nonlinear space by the optical nonlinear properties of nanophotonic reservoir computing. The testing-dataset forecast results of new cases, new deaths, cumulative cases, and cumulative deaths for six countries demonstrate that the forecasted blue curves are awfully close to the real red curves with exceedingly small forecast errors. Moreover, the forecast results commendably reflect the variations of the actual case data, revealing the different epidemic transmission laws in developed and developing countries. More importantly, the daily ahead forecast results during December 2021 of four kinds of cases for six countries illustrate that the daily forecasted values are highly coincident with the real values, while the relevant forecast errors are tiny enough to verify the good forecasting competence of COVID-19 pandemic dominated by Omicron strain. Therefore, the implemented nanophotonic reservoir computing can provide some foreknowledge on prevention strategy and healthcare management for COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely studied, relatively fewer discussions about the sentimental reaction of the public are available. In this article, we scrape COVID-19 related tweets on the microblogging platform, Twitter, and examine the tweets from February 24, 2020 to October 14, 2020 in four Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary) and four U.S. cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle). Applying the RoBERTa, Vader and NRC approaches, we evaluate sentiment intensity scores and visualize the results over different periods of the pandemic. Sentiment scores for the tweets concerning three anti-epidemic measures, "masks", "vaccine", and "lockdown", are computed for comparison. We explore possible causal relationships among the variables concerning tweet activities and sentiment scores of COVID-19 related tweets by integrating the echo state network method with convergent cross-mapping. Our analyses show that public sentiments about COVID-19 vary from time to time and from place to place, and are different with respect to anti-epidemic measures of "masks", "vaccines", and "lockdown". Evidence of the causal relationship is revealed for the examined variables, assuming the suggested model is feasible.},

Here, we introduce a simple and versatile structure of artificial sensory neurons based on a novel three-terminal Ovonic threshold switch (3T-OTS), which features an electrically controllable threshold voltage (Vth). Combined with a sensor driving an output voltage, this 3T-OTS generates spikes with a frequency depending on an external stimulus. As a proof of concept, we have built an artificial retinal ganglion cell (RGC) by combining a 3T-OTS and a photodiode. Furthermore, this artificial RGC is combined with the reservoir-computing technique to perform a classification of chest X-ray images for normal, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19 infections, releasing the recognition accuracy of about 86.5\%. These results indicate that the 3T-OTS is highly promising for applications in neuromorphic sensory systems, providing a building block for energy-efficient in-sensor computing devices.},

	abstract = {The remarkable flexibility and adaptability of both deep learning models and ensemble methods have led to the proliferation for their application in understanding many physical phenomena. Traditionally, these two techniques have largely been treated as independent methodologies in practical applications. This study develops an optimized ensemble deep learning framework wherein these two machine learning techniques are jointly used to achieve synergistic improvements in model accuracy, stability, scalability, and reproducibility, prompting a new wave of applications in the forecasting of dynamics. Unpredictability is considered one of the key features of chaotic dynamics; therefore, forecasting such dynamics of nonlinear systems is a relevant issue in the scientific community. It becomes more challenging when the prediction of extreme events is the focus issue for us. In this circumstance, the proposed optimized ensemble deep learning (OEDL) model based on a best convex combination of feed-forward neural networks, reservoir computing, and long short-term memory can play a key role in advancing predictions of dynamics consisting of extreme events. The combined framework can generate the best out-of-sample performance than the individual deep learners and standard ensemble framework for both numerically simulated and real-world data sets. We exhibit the outstanding performance of the OEDL framework for forecasting extreme events generated from a Liénard-type system, prediction of COVID-19 cases in Brazil, dengue cases in San Juan, and sea surface temperature in the Niño 3.4 region.},

We propose Bernstein–Bézier parametrisation and ESNs based algorithms to solve optimal control problems for systems governed by differential equations.

Almost all classifiers proposed so far assume that there is a constant number of features and they cannot treat a variable number of features. To cope with this difficulty, we examine a fixed number of questions like “how many points are in a certain range of a certain dimension”, and we convert the corresponding answers into a binary vector with a fixed length. These converted binary vectors are used as the basis for our classification. With respect to curve classification, many conventional methods are based on a frequency analysis such as Fourier analysis, a predictive analysis such as auto-regression, or a hidden Markov model. However, their resulting classification rules are difficult to interpret. In addition, they also rely on the global shape of curves and cannot treat cases in which only one part of a curve is important for classification. We propose some methods that are especially effective for such cases and the obtained rule is visualized.},
